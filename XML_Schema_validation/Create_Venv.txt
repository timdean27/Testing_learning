## Setting Up a Virtual Environment
### Create a virtual environment
1. In Bash:
    bash
    python -m venv myenv_xml_check
    
    or
    bash
    python -m venv .venv  # The dot makes it a hidden folder; can see with command ls -a
    
    **We are naming it .venv; it can be named arbitrarily.**

### Activate the virtual environment
1. On Windows:
    cmd
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
2. On Bash:
    - In the folder outside of `myenv_xml_check`:
    bash
    . myenv_xml_check/Scripts/activate
    
    **You should see (venv)**

### Verify virtual environment
1. Type `pip freeze` to see only packages in that environment, not global packages.

### Deactivate virtual environment
1. Type:
    bash
    deactivate
    

### List dependencies in `requirements.txt`
1. To push the dependencies to the `requirements.txt` file:
    bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    
2. To see what's in the requirements file, use:
    bash
    cat requirements.txt
    
### Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
1. Use:
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
